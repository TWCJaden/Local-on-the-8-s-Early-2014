# intellistar-emulator
A web application that displays weather information in the same visual presentation as the cable headend unit [Intellistar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliStar).

## Overview
This is an emulation of the Local on the 8's segment that is featured on The Weather Channel. Local on the 8's is normally generated on a custom server at your Cable Provider. This is the version from Early 2014, but the intro, hourly forecast, and outro portions have not been added. Backgrounds come from real STAR units. The music is what was played during that time. Feel free to edit this and add the features that were in the 2014, I won't be able to complete that.

## Instructions
## Option 1 (easier)
1. Visit: <https://cdn.rawgit.com/TWCJaden/Local-on-the-8-s-Early-2014/master/index.html>
2. Enter zip code
3. Click start
4. Press F11 for fullscreen

## Option 2 (more customizable)
1. Extract all contents into folder
2. Run index.html in Google Chrome
3. Enter zip code
4. Click start
5. Press F11 for fullscreen

## Features
Most of core animation and logic has been replicated including severe weather alerts, forecast descriptions, crawl text, and the Doppler radar map.

## Looping
To enable or disable looping, click on the TWC logo in the info-bar in the top-left corner of the emulator.

To get looping working properly, you may (as of Chrome M66) have to go to chrome://flags#autoplay-policy (Autoplay Policy) and change it to `User gesture is required for cross-origin iframes` or `No user gesture is required`
